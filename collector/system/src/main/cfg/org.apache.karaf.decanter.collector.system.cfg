# Decanter OperationSystem Collector configuration
#

# This collector executes system commands, retrieve the exec output/err
#Â sent to the appenders
#
# The format is command.key=command_to_execute
# where command is a reserved keyword used to identify a command property
# for instance:
#
# command.df=df -h
# command.free=free
#
# You can also create a script containing command like:
#
#   df -k / | awk -F " |%" '/dev/{print $8}'
#
# This script will get the available space on the / filesystem for instance.
# and call the script:
#
# command.df=/bin/script
#
# Another example of script to get the temperature:
#
#   sensors|grep temp1|awk '{print $2}'|cut -b2,3,4,5
#
