=== Custom Processor

A Decanter Processor is listening OSGi EventAdmin events from `decanter/collect/*` and send a new OSGi EventAdmin event to `decanter/process/*``

To see how to implement your own processor, you can take a look on the pass through processor: https://github.com/apache/karaf-decanter/blob/master/processor/passthrough/src/main/java/org/apache/karaf/decanter/processor/passthrough/PassThroughProcessor.java
