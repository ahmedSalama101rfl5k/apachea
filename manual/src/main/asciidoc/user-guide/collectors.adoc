=== Collectors

Decanter collectors harvest the monitoring data, and send this data to the Decanter appenders.

Two kinds of collector are available:

* Event Driven Collectors react to events and "broadcast" the data to the appenders.
* Polled Collectors are periodically executed by the Decanter Scheduler. When executed, the collectors harvest the
data and send to the appenders.

==== Log

The Decanter Log Collector is an event driven collector. It automatically reacts when a log occurs, and
send the log details (level, logger name, message, etc) to the appenders.

The `decanter-collector-log` feature installs the log collector:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-log
----

The log collector doesn't need any configuration, the installation of the decanter-collector-log feature is enough.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
The Decanter log collector is using `osgi:DecanterLogCollectorAppender` appender.
In order to work, your Apache Karaf Pax Logging configuration should contain this appender.

The default Apache Karaf `etc/org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg` configuration file is already fine:

----
log4j.rootLogger = DEBUG, out, osgi:*
----

If you want, you can explicitly specify the `DecanterLogCollectorAppender` appender:

----
log4j.rootLogger = DEBUG, out, osgi:DecanterLogCollectorAppender, osgi:VmLogAppender
----

=====================================================================


==== Log Socket

The Decanter Log Socket Collector is an event driven collector. It creates a socket, waiting for incoming event. The expected
events are log4j LoggingEvent. The log4j LoggingEvent is transformed as a Map containing the log details (level, logger name, message, ...).
This Map is sent to the appenders.

The collector allows you to remotely use Decanter. For instance, you can have an application running on a different platform (spring-boot,
application servers, ...). This application can use a log4j socket appender that send the logging events to the Decanter
log socket collector.

The `decanter-collector-log-socket` feature install the log socket collector:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-log-socket
----

This feature installs the collector and a default `etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.log.socket.cfg` configuration file
containing:

----
#
# Decanter Log/Log4j Socket collector configuration
#

#port=4560

----

* the `port`Â property defines the port number where the collector is bound and listen for incoming logging event. Default is 4560.

==== File

The Decanter File Collector is an event driven collector. It automatically reacts when new lines are appended into
a file (especially a log file). It acts like the tail Unix command. Basically, it's an alternative to the log collector.
The log collector reacts for local Karaf log messages, whereas the file collector can react to any files, included log
file from other system than Karaf. It means that you can monitor and send collected data for any system (even not Java
base, or whatever).

The file collector deals with file rotation, file not found.

The `decanter-collector-file` feature installs the file collector:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-file
----

Now, you have to create a configuration file for each file that you want to monitor. In the etc folder, you have to
create a file with the following format name `etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.file-ID.cfg` where ID is an ID
of your choice.

This file contains:

----
type=my
path=/path/to/file
any=value
----

* `type` is an ID (mandatory) that allows you to easily identify the monitored file
* `path` is the location of the file that you want to monitore
* all other values (like `any`) will be part of the collected data. It means that you can add your own custom data, and
easily create queries bases on this data.

For instance, instead of the log collector, you can create the following `etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.file-karaf.cfg`
file collector configuration file:

----
type=karaf-log-file
path=/path/to/karaf/data/log/karaf.log
my=stuff
----

The file collector will tail on karaf.log file, and send any new line in this log file as collected data.

==== JMX

The Decanter JMX Collector is a polled collector, executed periodically by the Decanter Scheduler.

The JMX collector connects to a JMX MBeanServer (local or remote), and retrieves all attributes of each available MBeans.
The JMX metrics (attribute values) are send to the appenders.

The `decanter-collector-jmx` feature installs the JMX collector, and a default configuration file:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-jmx
----

This feature brings a `etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.jmx-local.cfg` configuration file containing:

----
#
# Decanter Local JMX collector configuration
#

# Name/type of the JMX collection
type=jmx-local

# URL of the JMX MBeanServer.
# local keyword means the local platform MBeanServer or you can specify to full JMX URL
# like service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://hostname:port/karaf-instance
url=local

# Username to connect to the JMX MBeanServer
#username=karaf

# Password to connect to the JMX MBeanServer
#password=karaf

# Object name filter to use. Instead of harvesting all MBeans, you can select only
# some MBeans matching the object name filter
#object.name=org.apache.camel:context=*,type=routes,name=*
----

This file harvests the data of the local MBeanServer:

* the `type` property is a name (of your choice) allowing you to easily identify the harvested data
* the `url` property is the MBeanServer to connect. "local" is reserved keyword to specify the local MBeanServer.
Instead of "local", you can use the JMX service URL. For instance, for Karaf version 3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.0.2, and 3.0.3,
as the local MBeanServer is secured, you can specify `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/karaf-root`. You
can also polled any remote MBean server (Karaf based or not) providing the service URL.
* the `username` property contains the username to connect to the MBean server. It's only required if the MBean server
is secured.
* the `password` property contains the password to connect to the MBean server. It's only required if the MBean server
is secured.
* the `object.name` property is optional. If this property is not specified, the collector will retrieve the attributes
of all MBeans. You can filter to consider only some MBeans. This property contains the ObjectName filter to retrieve
the attributes only to some MBeans.
* any other values will be part of the collected data. It means that you can add your own property if you want to add
additional data, and create queries based on this data.

You can retrieve multiple MBean servers. For that, you just create a new configuration file using the file name format
`etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.jmx-[ANYNAME].cfg`.

==== ActiveMQ (JMX)

The ActiveMQ JMX collector is just a special configuration of the JMX collector.

The `decanter-collector-activemq` feature installs the default JMX collector, with the specific ActiveMQ JMX configuration:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-activemq
----

This feature installs the same collector as the `decanter-collector-jmx`, but also add the
`etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.jmx-activemq.cfg` configuration file.

This file contains:

----
#
# Decanter Local ActiveMQ JMX collector configuration
#

# Name/type of the JMX collection
type=jmx-activemq

# URL of the JMX MBeanServer.
# local keyword means the local platform MBeanServer or you can specify to full JMX URL
# like service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://hostname:port/karaf-instance
url=local

# Username to connect to the JMX MBeanServer
#username=karaf

# Password to connect to the JMX MBeanServer
#password=karaf

# Object name filter to use. Instead of harvesting all MBeans, you can select only
# some MBeans matching the object name filter
object.name=org.apache.activemq:*
----

This configuration actually contains a filter to retrieve only the ActiveMQ JMX MBeans.

==== Camel (JMX)

The Camel JMX collector is just a special configuration of the JMX collector.

The `decanter-collector-camel` feature installs the default JMX collector, with the specific Camel JMX configuration:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-camel
----

This feature installs the same collector as the `decanter-collector-jmx`, but also add the
`etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.jmx-camel.cfg` configuration file.

This file contains:

----
#
# Decanter Local Camel JMX collector configuration
#

# Name/type of the JMX collection
type=jmx-camel

# URL of the JMX MBeanServer.
# local keyword means the local platform MBeanServer or you can specify to full JMX URL
# like service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://hostname:port/karaf-instance
url=local

# Username to connect to the JMX MBeanServer
#username=karaf

# Password to connect to the JMX MBeanServer
#password=karaf

# Object name filter to use. Instead of harvesting all MBeans, you can select only
# some MBeans matching the object name filter
object.name=org.apache.camel:context=*,type=routes,name=*
----

This configuration actually contains a filter to retrieve only the Camel Routes JMX MBeans.

==== Camel Tracer

The Camel Tracer provides a Camel Tracer Handler that you can set on a Camel Tracer.

If you enable the tracer on a Camel route, all tracer events (exchanges on each step of the route) are send to the
appenders.

The `decanter-collector-camel-tracer` feature provides the Camel Tracer Handler:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-camel-tracer
----

Now, you can use the Decanter Camel Tracer Handler in a tracer that you can use in routes.

For instance, the following route definition shows how to enable tracer on a route, and use the Decanter Tracer Handler
in the Camel Tracer:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0">

    <reference id="eventAdmin" interface="org.osgi.service.event.EventAdmin"/>

    <bean id="traceHandler" class="org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.camel.DecanterTraceEventHandler">
        <property name="eventAdmin" ref="eventAdmin"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="tracer" class="org.apache.camel.processor.interceptor.Tracer">
        <property name="traceHandler" ref="traceHandler"/>
        <property name="enabled" value="true"/>
        <property name="traceOutExchanges" value="true"/>
        <property name="logLevel" value="OFF"/>
    </bean>

    <camelContext trace="true" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
        <route id="test">
            <from uri="timer:fire?period=10000"/>
            <setBody><constant>Hello World</constant></setBody>
            <to uri="log:test"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>

</blueprint>
----

==== System

The system collector is a polled collector (periodically executed by the Decanter Scheduler).

This collector executes operating system commands (or scripts) and send the execution output to the appenders.

The `decanter-collector-system` feature installs the system collector:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install decanter-collector-system
----

This feature installs a default `etc/org.apache.karaf.decanter.collector.system.cfg` configuration file containing:

----
#
# Decanter OperationSystem Collector configuration
#

# This collector executes system commands, retrieve the exec output/err
#Â sent to the appenders
#
# The format is key=command
# for instance:
# df=df -h
# free=free
# You can also create a script containing command like:
#
#   df -k / | awk -F " |%" '/dev/{print $8}'
#
# This script will get the available space on the / filesystem for instance.
# and call the script:
# df=/bin/script
#
# Another example of script to get the temperature:
#
#   sensors|grep temp1|awk '{print $2}'|cut -b2,3,4,5
#
----

You can add the commands that you want to execute using the format:

----
name=command
----

The collector will execute each command described in this file, and send the execution output to the appenders.

For instance, if you want to periodically send the free space available on the / filesystem, you can add:

----
df=df -k / | awk -F " |%" '/dev/{print $8}'
----
